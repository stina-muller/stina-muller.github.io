                <strong> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</strong><br>
                When you visit a webpage there are many different devices you can access it from, and the webpage should be able to move and breath with the screen size that the device has, which is important because it enables the visitor to use the website without issue regardless of the device they are using.

                <strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</strong><br>
                Moblie design is key because now many people access the web from their mobile devices. And your site is not mobile friendly, chances are the visitor will not have same experience via their mobile screen as a computer or laptop visitor would.

                <strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</strong><br>
                Frameworks are rules or codes that have been put in place and are universal, they are to make coding more convenient for those building similar styles or themes. The pros with using frameworks are that most of the work is done, but being generic can mean an unoriginal website. The more unique you want your site to be, the more you would need to create your own code or tweak frameworks.

                <strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong><br>
                Wireframe is a way of disecting your page into grids, or boxifying so you are able to put the structure of your website together based on the template for your site. It makes setting up your site much easier when you know exactly what you need where and how it should layout and function.

            <strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</strong><br>
            I found the most difficult part about implementing my wireframes was that my html/css vocaublary is very small, which was hard to know exactly what the correct tags were/are and if there were easier or better ones to make it easier to edit.
