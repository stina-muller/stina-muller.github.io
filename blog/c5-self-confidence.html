                <strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong><br>
                Mindfulness and Self-awareness are ulitmatly the same thing. Just a at a deeper level. Mindfulness is more about bring awareness and attention to your immediate moment to moment activities, where as self confindence is a by product of knowing, trusting and believing in oneself, which doesnt necessarly require a constant awareness of the moment.

                <strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong><br>
                I tried all of them, during the body scan I was really conscious of each part of my body as I was doing it. It was very relaxing to just be aware of the sensations that are associated with each part of the body and what that brought up. I found the dialog to be less as I allowed myself to just be witness to what was happening, rather than trying to make things happen.

                <strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>
                I liked how this part was explained, it gave me a lot more clarity to see the difference between "I am" vs. "I feel". Just this realisation gives me a wider understanding of how we identify ourselves, and how percieve others and ourselves. Very interesting.
