      <strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong><br>
      I would say that these components are ways of either creating, editing or navigating your way through a website. The HTML is the all the content, all the information about what is on the site. The CSS is the visual aspect of the website, how it looks, the fonts, colors, layouts etc, the overall 'look' of the website. The DOM is a way of navigating through Webpage's code to be able to view and see everything in a specific branch like structur. This enables you to view the page and the code at once, this tool is used to view how the set-up of both the HTML and the CSS together.

      <strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong><br>
      Boxifying is a term that is which describes breaking down a webpage into boxes. Everything on a webpage is ultimatly a box, and so being able to boxify when you are looking at webpage enables you to understand how the webpage is set up.
