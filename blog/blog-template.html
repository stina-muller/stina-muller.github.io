                1. What is your take on the DBA/EDA expereince?
                <li>My take on the experience that Shereef just talked about sounds exciting and makes me hopeful that I can complete this course.</li>
                2. What are your impressions?
                <li>My impression are that this seems well put together, although I am currently struggling with some parts of this first sprint, hearing that it is all part of the whole learning process, puts me at ease a little bit.</li>
                3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
                <li>My strengths are more in the culture of communication and pairing and learning from others, so I know that the culture aspect of the journey will be some what much easier than actually learning all the technical things.</li>
                4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
                <li>Not so much my expectations, but my outlook has been reconfirmed that it's going to be challenging but possible if you have the attitude.</li>
                5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
                <li>I am very excited to learn, I know it will be intense, and I am most nervous about not being able to understand all the technical things, I am already struggling with certain concepts in this first sprint.</li>
