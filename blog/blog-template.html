              <li>1. What is your take on the DBA/EDA expereince? My take on the experience that Shereef just talked about sounds exciting and makes me hopeful that I can complete this course.</li>
              <li>2. What are your impressions?
              My impression are that this seems well put together, although I am currently struggling with some parts of this first sprint, hearing that it is all part of the whole learning process, puts me at ease a little bit.</li>
              <li>3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
              My strengths are more in the culture of communication and pairing and learning from others, so I know that the culture aspect of the journey will be some what much easier than actually learning all the technical things.</li>
              <li>4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
              Not so much my expectations, but my outlook has been reconfirmed that it's going to be challenging but possible if you have the attitude.</li>
              <li>5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
              I am very excited to learn, I know it will be intense, and I am most nervous about not being able to understand all the technical things, I am already struggling with certain concepts in this first sprint.</li>
