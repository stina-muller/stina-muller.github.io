                <strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong><br>
                Having that intention in mind during this part of the sprint acutally helped me to focus on first setting up all the sections first then playing around later with the getting the details right. I found this process much eaiser to go through knowing that I don't need to have it perfect, it also helped me move through the task a lot quicker knowing that I style and such can be tweaked once each part is up in its place.

                <strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong><br>
                Each part of that chapter I feel like I knew, and not just as a concept, but from personal experience. Meditation is powerful tool that ultimalty brings awareness to oneself and I beleive that awarenes is the key to living a happy and enjoyable life, regardless of who you are and what you are doing in life.

                <strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong><br>
                I learnt quite a lot about the science of meditation, how the brain works and this chapter really touched on the factual aspects of meditation and mindfulness, which I think is a great way for someone who might understand it to be more of a superstious belief system rather than a study based on facts.

                <strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong><br>
                Yes all of them. I'm excited that this book exists for the mainstream.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Any other musings?</strong><br>
                I'm still in shock that this is part of our reading material. I never thought I would find this to be a part of a web development course.
