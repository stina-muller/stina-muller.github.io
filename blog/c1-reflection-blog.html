    <p>
      <strong>1. What is your take on the DBA/EDA expereince?</strong><br>
      My take on the experience that Shereef just talked about sounds exciting and makes me hopeful that I can complete this course.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. What are your impressions?</strong><br>
      My impression are that this seems well put together, although I am currently struggling with some parts of this first sprint, hearing that it is all part of the whole learning process, puts me at ease a little bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong><br>
      My strengths are more in the culture of communication and pairing and learning from others, so I know that the culture aspect of the journey will be some what much easier than actually learning all the technical things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong><br>
      Not so much my expectations, but my outlook has been reconfirmed that it's going to be challenging but possible if you have the attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br>
      I am very excited to learn, I know it will be intense, and I am most nervous about not being able to understand all the technical things, I am already struggling with certain concepts in this first sprint.
