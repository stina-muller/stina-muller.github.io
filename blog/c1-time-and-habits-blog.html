    <p>
      3. What worked for you?
      What works for me is meditation. I struggle quite a bit with time management mainly because I have been out of typical learning environment for a long time.

      4. Which will you experiment further with?
      I will keep trying to build my habits slowly, one step at time. Not trying to force change over night but continue to bring awareness to what my daily/weekly goals are.
