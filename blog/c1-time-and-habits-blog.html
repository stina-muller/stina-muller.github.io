                <strong>1.Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong><br>
                I tried all of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. What did you find interesting?</strong><br>
                I found many of the concepts interesting, all of them I know either from theory or practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. What worked for you?</strong><br>
                What works for me is meditation. I struggle quite a bit with time management mainly because I have been out of typical learning environment for a long time.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Which will you experiment further with?</strong><br>
                I will keep trying to build my habits slowly, one step at time. Not trying to force change over night but continue to bring awareness to what my daily/weekly goals are.
