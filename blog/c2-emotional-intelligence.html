                  <strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong><br>
                    This first chapter really opened my eyes to the sceientific aspects of mindful and meditation. I have been meditating and practicing mindfulness for the past 10 years, and so this is very familar to me. However I really appreciate this book for its in depth look into mindfulness from a purely scientific point of view. And being able to translate it into a modern form of communication has been a massive part of my journey in getting people to a place mindfullness and meditation is common and not alternitive, but more so a general thing that is implementent in our daily lives. I think its awesome companies are starting to incorporate this as part of work life.

                    <strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong><br>
                    I think this is perfect meditation for anyone who is knew to this sort of thing. I myself do a similar mindful excercise everyday and in big groups, so again it something I am very much acustomed to.
