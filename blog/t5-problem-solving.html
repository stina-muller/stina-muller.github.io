                <strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: 1.Got blocked on a simple problem 2.Solved a problem in an elegant way:</strong><br>
                I had problem with solving a task in Javascript Codeacademy. I had to create a function that would have a square change color when the mouse entered the sqaure, and went back to white when the mouse exited the square. I had copied the code as it was written but when I went to test it, I wasn't displaying anything in the browser. I went back through my code to check and it seemed fine. I wasnt sure what was going on, but then after about 5 mins of playing aroud I saw that the code was not complete because I didn't add a semi-colon at the end. During this process it was very frustrating because I knew the code was correct, and because I typed out the code instead of copying and pasting it, I missed this one small thing. It made really aware that I need to look closly at the code to make sure that all the correct tabs are closed and correctly too.

                <strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong><br>
                With regards to Pseudocode, at this point in time I do not feel confident in my ability to remember the functions and rules that I have recently learnt, however I am confident In my overall understanding of how and why the process works, and I know that once I am creating and using the code more frequently I will feel more capable to create code without refferring to other sources.
                <br>Trying something: I feel that if I understand what the task is asking of me, I am able to figure it out by going through it step by step from my notes. When I dont understand the task, it becomes a bigger because I need go in search of other sources to first of all understand what it is I am supposed to be doing.
                <br>Not sure if I used the Rubber Ducky Method, which I understand to be Debugging by going through each line of code to explain what the code is doing. I guess I do use this method when I am stuck, looking at the code (in comparison to a similar code) to see where I have gone wrong or see what my next line of code should look like.
                <br>When it comes to reading error messages, I am able to recitify the error only if I understand what the error is. There have been errors where I have no idea what it is asking me to do so I go back over the code and see where my mistake is.
                <br>I feel semi-confident with console logging, I understand what it is and I know how it works.
                <br>Googling is my number 1 go to for trouble shooting, unless there is a hint or a guide, if I dont know what something is I will 100% of the time google it.
                <br>I am confident in asking my peers for help, however, I guess I don't use this resource as much as I could be. This is usally the final thing I do if I can't figure out something.
                <br>Also the same with asking coaches for help, I tend to want to figure it out on my own first without asking for help until I really get stuck.
                <br> Improving your process with reflection: I guess I perceive reflection as helping with the cultural side of things, I do however feel confident in my abilities to reflect on all situations, even technical aspect, however I feel like that is also a last resort thing, not something I would immediately turn to for problem solving.
